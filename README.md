# MOTIVOTE - ULTIMATE VOTE REWARD SCRIPT #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download latest version of Motivote (you probably already have, since you're reading this!)
* Upload them to your web host
* In your FTP client, chmod config.php to 0777. In FileZilla, right click config.php and select "File Permissions" at the bottom. Enter "Numeric value" of 777.
* In your browser, go to the folder you just uploaded the script to. For example, http://example.com/vote/
* From there, you will need to follow the instructions and set up your installation!

### What if something goes wrong? ###

* Contact zomgtehfly on Skype and I'll be glad to try and get you up and running.
* Please report all bugs you may find to me ASAP so I can fix them.
